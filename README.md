# Widgets
The Laravel widgets

Dear developers! I created this package for my projects. In order to do manual updates all the time, I decided to upload this package to packagist.
If you have reached this page and you need widgets for a project, then, unfortunately, there is no time for documentation. It may soon appear!

Installation
------------

```bash
composer require keerill/widgets
```
