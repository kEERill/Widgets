Creating widget
---

Let's start with the easiest, this is creating a new widget

```bash
php artisan widget:create UserInfo
```

After executing the command, the widget will be located at `app/Widgets/UserInfo.php`. 
As for me, it seemed reasonable to use the app/Widgets folder as the root folder with widgets.
